Quick Visualizations Driven By Music Consumption Patterns

Attempted to visualize all of the data in a hierarchial (sunburst) format, but that proved difficult to read.
Quickly wiewed timeseries data with matplotlib, again, nothing earth shattering there.
Changed the scope to focus on skips (duration < 30 seconds) and possible contributors (facets and time).
